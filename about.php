<div id="container">     <h2>About us</h2>     <p>Allemny is an initiative that was created in 2011 by Life Makers, faculty of engineering, Alexandria University. Allemny mainly aims to change the traditional way of education that brought up people to be dependents; most of students depend on others to get information, you can rarely find a student who searches to get what we need to understand. We can rarely find a student who depends on self-Learning.</p>     


<p>We are working to encourage self-learning using new education tactics to cope with the modern technologies; we provide education for those who need it whenever they want. We are creating online Videos that illustrate topics which help students who are interested in any of these topics to start searching and reading about them.</p>     

<h3>Vision</h3>

It has become a necessity to enhance the outdated education tactics. Consequently, we need to discover innovative methods to disseminate science and technology in all fields</p>     
<p>This can be easily achieved through the recent widespread means, the internet. We provide education for those who need it whenever they want.
