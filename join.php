Allemny mainly aims to encourage self-Learning and to keep teaching techniques up to date by using new education tactics to cope with the modern technologies. We are creating short videos that explain engineering topics and software in an easy way, so that everybody can understand our data.<br><br>It is our belief that science and education have always been the principal foundation of civilization and progression of nations. It has become a necessity to enhance the outdated education tactics. We provide education for those who need it whenever they want. We are creating online Videos that illustrate scientific topics which help students who are interested in any of these topics to start searching and reading about them.</p><br>
